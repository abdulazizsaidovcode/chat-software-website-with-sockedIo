# Real-Time Chat Application

Welcome to the Real-Time Chat Application repository! This project showcases my skills in building a responsive chat application using React.js, styled with Styled Components. The backend is powered by Express.js and MongoDB, enabling users to create accounts, exchange messages, and enjoy real-time communication using Socket.io.

## Project Overview

I developed a feature-rich chat application with the following highlights:
- Responsive Design: The application offers a seamless experience from desktop to mobile devices, ensuring users can chat on the go.
- Styling with Styled Components: Styling is implemented using Styled Components, enabling modular and maintainable styling.
- Real-Time Communication: Real-time response is achieved using Socket.io, allowing users to exchange messages instantaneously.
- User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out. Authentication is implemented using local storage for a seamless experience.
- Data Storage: Messages, user profiles, and avatars are stored in MongoDB, ensuring data persistence and retrieval.
- Emoji Support: Added emojis for messages, enhancing user communication and expression.
